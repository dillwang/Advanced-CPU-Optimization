# Advanced-CPU-Optimization

This is an on going CPU architecture design group project that primarily focus on implementing modern state of the art optimization methods to speedup a simple baseline CPU architecture.
Here are some potential optimization methods that we are considering:
- Branch prediction
- Out-of-order execution
- Cache optimizations
- Superscalar execution
- Hardware prefetching
- Multithreading
- Runahead execution
